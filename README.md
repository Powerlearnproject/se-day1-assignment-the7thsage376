Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the designing and coding of applications and systems that are developed, tested,deployed and maintained using engineering principles. It is very crucial in the technology industry as it helps create software applications and systems that are a cruical part of everyday life, like Netflix and Whatsapp.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Those three milestones are:
1. The creation and development of programming languages
2. The establishing of Software engineering as a discipline
3. The rise of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: the gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: The creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: The writing of code and the building of software according to the design specifications agreed upon on the design phase.
4.  Testing: Validate the software using various tests to ensure that quality standards and functional requirements are met.
5.  Deployment: Releasing the software to the production environment. Ensure that it's accessible to end users and to provide initial support.
6.  Maintenance: To Monitor,maintain and update the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 The Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases that has little to no room for changes.Each phase must be completed before the next. An appropriate example of this approach is an E-commerce website that sells clothing.Litlle to no changes have to be made to the website as there's no need.
 The Agile methodology on the otherhand, is iterative and incremental. It's a very flexible approach towards software engineering and focuses more on collaboration and responding to change. An appropriate example of this would be a mobile fitness app, which would have to constantly change to meet the needs of different body types and different types of exercises and routines.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

The role of each type of developer is as follows:
1. Software developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance engineer: They ensure that sofware quality is maintained by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are important because they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. An example is Vsual Studio code.
Version control systems is a software tool that is used for managing changes to the source code,coordinating work among team members, and maintaining the history of the project's development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing requirements during the development process. Solution: using agile methodologies.
2. Tight deadlines. Solution:prioritization of tasks.
3. Technical debt, caused by shortcuts and suboptimal solutions.Solution: regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of software
Integration Testing: Verifying that different components or modules work together as expected.
System Testing:Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing:Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It is the process of designing and refining input prompts in order to get specific responses from AI models. It's importance is to receive relevant information from AI models,and is useful in training the models into giving more specific information.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt is: Why is Steven Universe gay?
A more specific prompt would be: Why is Steven Universe so diverse in gender identity and sexual orientation?
The prompt becomes clearer and better because we are focusing more on the main themes of the show, thus getting a better result when asking the AI model.
